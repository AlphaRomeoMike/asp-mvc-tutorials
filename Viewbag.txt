Passing data from Controller to View
	We can use 
		Viewbag,
		Viewdata,
		TempData

ViewData passes data from controller to view:
	Is a dictionary of objects
	Exists only during the current request, means we cannot share data in between 
	views
	ViewData value becomes null if the request is redirected
	It requires typecasting when you use complex data type to avoid error
	Syntax: 
	ViewData["Key"] = <Value>;

Note: 	ViewData does not provide compile time error checking, you get to know about the
	error only at runtime
